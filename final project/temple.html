                        <h2>Manasadevi Temple,Haridwar</h2>
                        In sharp contrast to the Mansa Devi temple, Patiala temple has a typical ' nagara' curvelinear
                        spire with miniature shrines decorated on its body from bottom to top of the spire. This
                        architectural a style definitely goes in consonance with the shivalik background.
