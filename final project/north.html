                        <h2>Kullu-Manali</h2>
                        A trip to Kullu Manali is the medicine for fatigued minds and tired souls. Nature has blessed
                        them
                        generously, and yet, one is different from the kind of experiences they offer. Kullu is called
                        the “land of
                        the gods”, and quite aptly so.Both Kullu and Manali, top tourist destinations of Himachal
                        Pradesh, seem to
                        outdo the other in their scenic magnificence and opportunities for sightseeing & adventure.
                        Kullu, the town
                        believed to be apt for the gods, pleasantly surprises the visitor with the diversity it offers.
                        In Manali,
                        what you see is what you get, raw beauty with serenity, the likes of which you may have only
                        dreamt
                        about.There are also 2 day trkking trip.

                        <h2>Mussoorie,Dehradun</h2>
                        Mussoorie, also known as Queen of the Hills, is among the most popular hill stations of the
                        country. A
                        Britisher, Captain Frederick Young, accompanied by an official named FJ Shore, had climbed up
                        the hill
                        from the Doon valley in 1827 and found this ridge offering great views and a salubrious climate.
                        This
                        visit laid the foundation for this grand hill station. The best time to visit Mussoorie is
                        during
                        summers, as it offers respite from the scorching summer heat. However, if you are looking for a
                        secluded
                        holiday, come here during winters to witness the snowfall.</p>

                        is very
                        popular tourist's hub because of its abundant natural beauty and open grasslands. The entry gate
                        of the
                        zone is located at only 01 Km from Ramnagar city.hirna is another important tourist zone in the

                        zone in
                        November 2014.Bengal tigers, although plentiful, are not easily spotted due to the abundance of
                        foliage
                        - camouflage - in the reserve. Thick jungle, the Ramganga river and plentiful prey make this

                        ideal habitat for tigers who are opportunistic feeders and prey upon a range of animals. </p>

                        Rishikesh, also spelt as Hrishikesh, is a city governed by Rishikesh Municipal Corporation
                        (since
                        October 2017), and a tehsil in Dehradun district of the Indian state Uttarakhand.In February
                        1968, the
                        Beatles visited the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, attracted by his Transcendental
                        Meditation. The Beatles composed numerous songs during their time at the ashram, many of
                        which

                        followed, increasing participation in yoga, to the extent that Rishikesh has been nicknamed
                        "Yoga

                        temporary sites, do not have adequate sewage and sanitation facilities, disturb the habitat of
                        wild
